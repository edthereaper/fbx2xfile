This project will strive to create such a tool, which convert the 3D format of fbx to xFile.

Autodesk 3dsmax is strong for composing 3D model and animation, but as I know, there is no tools, which can directly convert 3dsmax file to .x format, up to now.

With the help of this project, it is easy to convert a 3dsmax animation model to .x format by using FBX format as an intermediate format, which is an official format of Autodesk.

You can reach me by my gmail, if you have any questions or suggestions?

Thanks for your attention!
